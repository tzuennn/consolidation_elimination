    "*   **Data Driven:** The process is driven by the `internal_transactions_data` list. In a real system, this data would likely come from a database, making the process highly automated.\n",
    "*   **Consistency:** The same rules are applied every time, reducing human error compared to manual spreadsheet adjustments.\n",
